taquin 3x3


there 9 boxes u need to fill in only 8 with numbers from 1 to 8

u can fill them in what ever position u would like and the programme will make them in the right position[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,]. by adding other tables to the page when the program finish running (careful some times it might take a minute because of calculation  so u need to be patient) and in the final results u ll find all steps to get from the current position u were in until reach the solution .
